# M-Ionic
Prediction of metal ion binding sites from sequence using residue embeddings

A pipeline to identify proteins which bind to metals as well as which residues in the protein are involved in metal-binding. The output of this method provides ion-specific probabilities for each residue. 

## Overview:
1. __Input:__ fasta file containing one protein sequence
2. Prepare residue-level embeddings
3. Predict the binding probability using the saved model parameters 
4.  __Output:__ the predicted binding probability for each ion for each residue in the protein sequence
